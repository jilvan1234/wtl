Introduction
 
Windows Template Library, or WTL, is a set of classes that extend ATL to support more complex user interfaces for either applications or various UI components, while maintaining the big advantage of ATL - small and fast code. WTL classes were designed to be the best and the easiest way to implement rich Win32 based UI for ATL based applications, servers, components, and controls.
 
WTL provides support for implementing many user interface elements, from frame and popup windows, to MDI, standard and common controls, common dialogs, property sheets and pages, GDI objects, UI updating, scrollable windows, splitter windows, command bars, etc. The WTL classes are mostly templated and use minimal instance data and inline functions. They were not designed as a framework, so they do not force a particular application model, and can accommodate any. The classes do not use hooks or thread local storage, so they have no restrictions that those techniques impose. They also have no inter-dependencies and can be freely mixed with straight SDK code. In summary, WTL delivers very small and efficient code, very close in size and speed to SDK programs, while presenting a more logical, object oriented model to a programmer.
 
 
Features and Installation
 
This is the eigth public release of WTL, after WTL 3.0, 3.1, 7.0, 7.1, 7.5, 8.0, and 9.0. This version is released under the Microsoft Public License, enabling developers from the WTL community to contribute to the library.
 
WTL classes can be used with either VC++ 6.0, VC++ .NET 2002 or 2003, VC++ 2005 or 2008 or 2010 or 2012 or 2013 or 2015, or EVC++ 4.0 or 3.0. AppWizard for Visual Studio is included.
 
The WTL classes are provided in header files located in the include directory. The only header files that must be included is atlapp.h, while others can be used when needed. The name of the file doesn't mean that you have to create an application, just that atlapp.h contains base definitions required for WTL projects.
 
To install WTL, just copy the whole directory structure, or unpack the archive file, to the location of your choice. Please be sure to add the WTL\include directory to the list of include directories in VC++, so that the compiler can find them when you include them in your projects..
 
Setup programs for the AppWizard are provided. After executing the setup script, ATL/WTL AppWizard will appear in the list of AppWizards when you select File.New.Project in VC++ IDE. The file AppWiz\setup.js is the setup script for all supported versions of Visual Studio, while AppWizards for Windows CE have separate scripts for VS2005 and VS2008 SmartDevice projects.
 
To manually install AppWizard for VC++ .NET 2002/2003, copy all WTLAppWiz.* files from AppWiz\Files to VC++ .NET projects directory, %VC7DIR%\Vc7\vcprojects, where %VC7DIR% is the directory where VC++ .NET 2002/2003 is installed. After that, open WTLAppWiz.vsz and modify the like that contains ABSOLUTE_PATH to contain %WTLDIR%\AppWiz\Files, where %WTLDIR% is the directory where WTL files are.

ATL/WTL AppWizard
 
ATL/WTL AppWizard generates starting code for a WTL application. It has options to create code for different application types and features.
 
You can choose the following options:
Application type (SDI, multi thread SDI, MDI, TabView, Explorer, dialog based)
Support for hosting ActiveX controls
COM server support
Class implementation in .CPP files
Common Control manifest
Unicode character set
Toolbar, rebar, command bar, status bar
View window, and it's type (generic, dialog based form, or a list box, edit, list view, tree view, rich edit based, HTML page, scroll window)
For dialog based apps or a form based view window - support for hosting ActiveX controls in the dialog
 
ATL/WTL AppWizard supports VC++ .NET 2002 and 2003, VC++ 2005, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2015.
 
 
Support for Windows CE
 
WTL fully supports building projects for the Windows CE platforms. The initial support for Windows CE was implemented primarily for eMbedded Visual C++ 4.0 with Pocket PC 2003 and SmartPhone 2003 SDKs. However, it can be used with other versions and configurations. For instance, Standard SDK 4.1 or 5.0 is supported as well. Considerable effort was made to provide the best Windows CE support, however, there might be some limitations because different platforms provide different programming support. SmartDevice projects with Visual Studio 2005 and 2008 are also supported, and it also includes an AppWizard for VS2005 and VS2008.
 
The support for Windows CE was not designed to port projects for the desktop version of Windows as-is to the Windows CE platforms, but to allow use of the same library, WTL, for both desktop Windows and Windows CE. Applications for Windows CE are often designed in a different way, and they use different platform services. WTL depends on the version of ATL provided with each Windows CE platform, and supports controls and services that are appropriate and supported for each Windows CE platform.
 
 
Support for Visual C++ Express
 
Note: Visual Studio Express is not the only or the best free development environment any more - Visual Studio Community provides a complete release of Visual Studio for free.
 
WTL supports using Visual C++ Express Edition to build projects. Since Visual C++ Express ships without ATL, you have to use a version of ATL that ships with Windows Driver Kit 7.1.0 or Platform SDK (Windows Server 2003 R2 Platform SDK).
 
Windows Driver Kit 7.1.0 contains ATL version 8, while Platform SDK has ATL version 3. We recomend ATL from Windows Driver Kit since it is newer and better version. However, you can still use ATL from Platform SDK since WTL still fully supports ATL3.
 
The WTL App Wizard can be installed by running AppWiz\setup.js program. The App Wizard generates code in the stdafx.h file that allows use of ATL. That code is used if _WTL_SUPPORT_EXTERNAL_ATL is defined, so you can comment the line in stdafx.h that defines _WTL_SUPPORT_EXTERNAL_ATL to use the project with different versions of Visual C++ or ATL.
 
Note that Release builds might generate some warnings, since ATL3 from Platform SDK is an old version of ATL which doesn't quite match the newer compiler and CRT files. You can ignore those warnings, as they do not indicate any real problems with the code.
 
Supported VC++ versions:
VC++ 2005 Express
VC++ 2008 Express
VC++ 2010 Express
VC++ Express 2012 for Windows Desktop
VC++ Express 2013 for Windows Desktop

Notes
 
~    WTL provides several classes that are also present in ATL 7.0 and 7.1. The classes are: CSize, CPoint, CRect, and CString in atlmisc.h. While their existence will not cause any problems, their usage might. You should qualify the class you want to use with a namespace to resolve ambiguity, either ATL or WTL namespace, depending on which implementation you want to use. Alternatively, you can conditionally exclude WTL implementations, by defining preprocessor symbol _WTL_NO_WTYPES for CSize, CPoint, and CRect; and _WTL_NO_CSTRING for CString.
 
~    If you use WTL 9.0 with VC++ 6.0/ATL 3.0 and define _ATL_STATIC_REGISTRY, you'll get errors referring to the ambiguous symbol ATL. This is caused by a bug in ATL 3.0 - in atlbase.h, the file statreg.h is included inside of the ATL namespace, and it contains another namespace ATL declaration. Because of that, the compiler cannot decide between ATL:: and ATL::ATL:: namespaces. The solution is either to fix the atlbase.h, or to surround atlbase.h include declaration with following statements:
 
    #define ATL   ATLFIX
    #include <atlapp.h>
    #undef ATL
    namespace ATL = ::ATLFIX;
 
~    Windows XP allows applications to use Common Controls version 6, which supports only Unicode applications. While WTL allows creation of Ansi applications that use Common Controls 6, that should be used only for test programs and is not recommended or supported for released projects. If you want to use Common Controls 6, build your application as Unicode.
 
~    If you build your app that hosts ActiveX controls with VC++ 7.x, you can see this assert failing:

    !InlineIsEqualGUID(*m_plibid, GUID_NULL) && "Did you forget to pass the LIBID to CComModule::Init?"

There are two ways to fix this:
In the main .CPP file of your project, replace the line
    hRes = _Module.Init(NULL, hInstance);
with this one
    hRes = _Module.Init(NULL, hInstance, &LIBID_ATLLib);
 
Compile you project with _ATL_DLL defined (dynamic link to ATL)
~    Several of the sample programs included with WTL were extended to support building for Windows CE. These samples are not specially redesigned for Windows CE, but just modified to allow you to compile and run them on the Windows CE platforms. The samples are: BmpView, GuidGen, and MTPad.
 
~    WTL supports building projects with EVC++ 3.0 only for Pocket PC and Pocket PC 2002 platforms, as other platforms don't provide minimum support for ATL or other required libraries.
 
~    The old AppWizards for VC++ 6.0 and eVC++ 4.0/3.0 are not included in this version of WTL because they cannot be a part of an Open Source project. They are still available in the previous release, WTL 7.1.
 
~    Visual Studio 2012 and higher use default subsystem version 6.0 (Windows Vista). Previous versions of Visual Studio used 5.01 (Windows XP). That means that applications built with Visual Studio 2012 and higher cannot run on Windows XP. Attempting to run would result in an error that it is not a valid Win32 application. If you want to run your applications on Windows XP, you need to change subsystem version to 5.01. You can do that by going to Project Properties -> Linker -> System -> Minimum Required Version, and entering 5.01 as a value.
